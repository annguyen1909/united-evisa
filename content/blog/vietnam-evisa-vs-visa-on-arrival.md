Vietnam offers multiple visa options to international travelers. Two popular types are the **e-Visa** and the **Visa on Arrival (VOA)**. But which is right for you?

## Key Differences Between e-Visa and Visa on Arrival

| Application | Online | Online pre-approval + on-arrival stamp |
| Entry Points | Fixed list of ports | Only international airports |
| Processing Time | 3 working days | 2–3 days for approval letter |
| Fee | One-time online fee | Letter fee + stamping fee at airport |
| Duration | 30 days (single entry) | 30–90 days (varies) |
| Lines at Airport | No extra lines | May need to wait for stamping |

## Pros and Cons

### ✅ e-Visa

- Simple and paperless process  
- No lines at visa counter  
- Entry through many land/sea/air points  

### ✅ Visa on Arrival

- Good for those **unable to get e-Visa**  

## Final Verdict
