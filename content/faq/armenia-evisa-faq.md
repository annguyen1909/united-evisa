## What is the best time to visit Armenia?

The best time to visit Armenia is during spring (April-June) and autumn (September-November) when the weather is pleasant and comfortable for sightseeing and outdoor activities. Summer can be hot, especially in lower elevations, while winter can be quite cold with snow in mountainous regions. These shoulder seasons offer the best combination of good weather and fewer crowds.

## What are the must-visit destinations in Armenia?

Popular destinations include Yerevan (the historic capital), Lake Sevan (one of the largest high-altitude lakes in the world), Tatev Monastery (accessible by the world's longest cable car), Dilijan National Park (known as "Armenian Switzerland"), Geghard Monastery (a UNESCO World Heritage site), and the ancient city of Echmiadzin. Each offers unique historical, cultural, or natural attractions.

## What should I know about Armenian culture and customs?

Armenia is a Christian country with rich cultural traditions. The Armenian Apostolic Church plays an important role in society. Armenians are known for their hospitality and strong family values. When visiting religious sites, dress modestly and remove hats. Learning a few basic Armenian phrases is appreciated. The country has a strong coffee culture, and sharing meals is an important social activity.

## What currency is used in Armenia and can I use credit cards?

The official currency is the Armenian Dram (AMD). While credit cards are increasingly accepted in major hotels, restaurants, and shops in Yerevan and tourist areas, it's advisable to carry cash for smaller establishments, markets, and rural areas. ATMs are widely available in cities and towns. US Dollars and Euros can sometimes be exchanged, but drams are preferred for daily transactions.
