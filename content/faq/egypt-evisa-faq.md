## Do I need a visa to visit Egypt?

Most foreign nationals require a visa to enter Egypt. The Egypt eVisa system allows travelers from eligible countries to apply online before their trip. The eVisa is mandatory for tourism purposes and must be obtained before arrival. Citizens of some Arab countries may be exempt from visa requirements, but most visitors need to apply for an eVisa through our platform.

Our platform has a 98% approval rate, and we provide 24/7 support throughout the application process to ensure smooth processing.

## What documents do I need for an Egypt eVisa?

You'll need a valid passport with at least 6 months validity beyond your intended stay, a recent passport-size photo, proof of accommodation in Egypt, return flight tickets, and sufficient funds for your stay. All documents should be clear, legible, and in English. Make sure your passport has at least two blank pages for entry stamps.

## Can I extend my Egypt visa while in the country?

Yes, you can extend your Egypt visa while in the country. You'll need to visit the Immigration Department in Cairo or other major cities before your current visa expires. Extensions are typically granted for valid reasons such as medical treatment, business needs, or tourism. There are fees associated with visa extensions, and the process can take several days, so plan accordingly.

## What are the different types of Egypt eVisas available?

Egypt offers two main types of eVisas: Tourist eVisa (Single Entry for 30 days) costing $75 USD for tourism, cultural visits, and sightseeing, and Tourist eVisa (Multiple Entries for 30 days) costing $110 USD for extended stays, business trips, and family visits. Both allow stays of up to 30 days from the date of entry.

## Which entry points can I use with an Egypt eVisa?

Egypt eVisa holders can enter through Cairo International Airport, Hurghada International Airport, Sharm El Sheikh International Airport, and other designated ports of entry. You can also enter through designated land borders and seaports. Always carry your eVisa approval letter and passport when traveling, as these will be checked at immigration.

## Is it safe to travel to Egypt?

Yes, Egypt is generally safe for tourists, especially in popular tourist areas like Cairo, Luxor, Aswan, and Red Sea resorts. However, it's important to stay informed about current travel advisories and take standard safety precautions like not walking alone at night and staying in tourist areas. Most tourist destinations have good security measures in place.

## What is the best time to visit Egypt?

The best time to visit Egypt depends on what you want to see and do. For sightseeing and exploring ancient sites, the cooler months from October to April are ideal with pleasant temperatures. The summer months (May-September) can be very hot, especially in southern Egypt, but are great for Red Sea beach activities and diving. Winter is perfect for Nile cruises.

## What should I know about Egyptian culture and customs?

Egypt is a predominantly Muslim country, so it's important to dress modestly, especially when visiting mosques and religious sites. Remove shoes before entering mosques, and women should cover their hair. During Ramadan, be respectful of those fasting. Tipping (baksheesh) is customary for services. Friday is the holy day, so some businesses may be closed or have limited hours.

## Can I take photos at tourist sites in Egypt?

Photography is generally allowed at most tourist sites, but some locations may charge additional fees for cameras. Photography is prohibited inside most tombs and museums to preserve artifacts. Always ask permission before photographing people, especially women, and be respectful of local customs. Professional photography equipment may require special permits.
