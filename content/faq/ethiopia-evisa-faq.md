## Do I need a visa to visit Ethiopia?

Most foreign nationals require a visa to enter Ethiopia. The Ethiopia eVisa system allows travelers from eligible countries to apply online before their trip for tourism purposes. Some African countries may be exempt from visa requirements or have different arrangements, so it's important to check your specific nationality's eligibility on our platform before applying.

## How long does it take to process an Ethiopia eVisa?

Processing time for Ethiopia eVisas typically takes 3 working days for normal processing and 1 working day for super urgent processing. We recommend applying at least 1 week before your intended travel date to avoid any delays. Our platform has a 98% approval rate, and we provide 24/7 support throughout the application process.

## What documents do I need for an Ethiopia eVisa?

You'll need a valid passport with at least 6 months validity beyond your intended stay, a recent passport-size photo, proof of accommodation in Ethiopia, return flight tickets, and sufficient funds for your stay. All documents should be clear, legible, and in English. Make sure your passport has blank pages for entry stamps.

## Can I extend my Ethiopia visa while in the country?

Yes, you can extend your Ethiopia visa while in the country. You'll need to visit the Immigration Department in Addis Ababa or other major cities before your current visa expires. Extensions are typically granted for valid reasons such as medical treatment, business needs, or extended tourism. There are fees associated with visa extensions, and the process can take several days.

## What type of Ethiopia eVisa is available?

Ethiopia currently offers a Tourist eVisa (Single Entry for 30 days) costing $112 USD. This visa is designed for tourism, cultural tours, and sightseeing purposes. The visa allows a single entry with a stay of up to 30 days from the date of entry. The visa is valid for 60 days from the date of issue, giving you flexibility in your travel timing.

## Which entry points can I use with an Ethiopia eVisa?

Ethiopia eVisa holders can primarily enter through Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, which is the main international gateway to the country. Some other designated entry points may be available, but Addis Ababa is the most reliable and commonly used entry point. Always carry your eVisa approval letter and passport when traveling.

## Is it safe to travel to Ethiopia?

Yes, Ethiopia is generally safe for tourists, especially in popular tourist areas like Addis Ababa, Lalibela, and the Simien Mountains. However, it's important to stay informed about current travel advisories and take standard safety precautions. Most tourist destinations have good security measures in place, and the tourism infrastructure is well-developed in major areas.

## What is the best time to visit Ethiopia?

The best time to visit Ethiopia depends on what you want to see and do. For sightseeing and cultural tours, the dry season (October-May) is ideal when roads are more accessible and weather is favorable. The rainy season (June-September) can make some areas difficult to access but brings lush green landscapes. For trekking in the Simien Mountains, the cooler months (October-March) are most comfortable.

## What are the must-visit destinations in Ethiopia?

Popular destinations include Addis Ababa (the capital and cultural hub), Lalibela (famous for its rock-hewn churches), the Simien Mountains (for trekking and wildlife), Axum (ancient historical sites), Lake Tana (source of the Blue Nile), the Omo Valley (for cultural experiences with local tribes), and the Danakil Depression (one of the lowest and hottest places on Earth). Each offers unique historical, cultural, or natural attractions.

## What should I know about Ethiopian culture and customs?

Ethiopia has a rich cultural heritage with its own calendar, time system, and ancient Christian traditions. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church plays an important role in society. Ethiopians are known for their hospitality and coffee culture - Ethiopia is considered the birthplace of coffee. When visiting religious sites, dress modestly and follow local customs. Learning basic Amharic phrases is appreciated, though English is widely spoken in tourist areas.
