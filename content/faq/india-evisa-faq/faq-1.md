## How do I start my India eVisa application?

Visit the official India eVisa website or use our trusted platform to begin your application. You'll need to create an account, fill out the online form with your personal details, travel information, and upload required documents. Make sure to have all necessary documents ready before starting the application to avoid delays.

## What personal information is required for the India eVisa application?

You'll need to provide your full name (as on passport), date of birth, nationality, passport details (number, issue and expiry dates), contact information, employment details, and travel information including intended arrival date, port of entry, and purpose of visit. All information must match your passport exactly.

## How do I upload documents for my India eVisa?

Documents must be uploaded in specific formats - passport bio page as PDF, photo as JPEG. File sizes should be under 300KB for photos and 1MB for passport pages. Ensure documents are clear, legible, and meet the specified dimensions. Poor quality uploads are a common reason for application rejection.

## Can I edit my India eVisa application after submission?

Once submitted and payment is made, you cannot edit your India eVisa application. However, if you notice errors before payment, you can go back and correct them. After submission, if critical errors are found, you may need to apply again with correct information, which requires paying the fee again.

## What happens after I submit my India eVisa application?

After submission and payment, you'll receive an acknowledgment email with your application ID. Your application will be processed within 72 hours for regular processing or 24 hours for urgent processing. You'll receive an email notification once your eVisa is approved, and you should print the approval letter to carry while traveling.

## How do I track my India eVisa application status?

You can track your application status using your application ID and passport number on the official eVisa website or through our platform. The status will show as "Granted" when approved, "Rejected" if denied, or "Under Process" while being reviewed. Keep your application ID safe for tracking purposes.

## What should I do if my India eVisa application is rejected?

If rejected, you'll receive an email with the reason for rejection. Common reasons include incorrect information, poor quality documents, or incomplete application. You can reapply after addressing the issues mentioned in the rejection notice. There's no refund for rejected applications, so ensure accuracy before submitting.

## Can I apply for an India eVisa on behalf of someone else?

Yes, you can apply for family members, especially children under 18, using their details and documents. However, each person needs a separate application and must meet all requirements individually. The applicant's details must be used throughout the application, not the person filling it out.

## What payment methods are accepted for India eVisa?

India eVisa fees can be paid using major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express) or debit cards. Some platforms may accept PayPal or bank transfers. Ensure your card is enabled for international transactions. Payment must be completed to submit the application for processing.

## Do I need to visit an embassy or consulate for India eVisa?

No, the India eVisa is completely online. You don't need to visit any embassy or consulate. The entire process from application to approval is handled electronically. You simply need to carry the printed eVisa approval letter when traveling to India along with your passport.
