## What documents do I need to carry when traveling to India with an eVisa?

You must carry your original passport (with at least 6 months validity), printed eVisa approval letter, return flight tickets, and proof of sufficient funds. Immigration officers may also ask for accommodation proof. Keep physical copies as backup, and ensure your passport has at least two blank pages for entry stamps.

## Are there any health requirements for traveling to India?

Yellow fever vaccination is required if arriving from infected areas. COVID-19 requirements may apply depending on current health protocols. It's recommended to be up-to-date with routine vaccines and consider hepatitis A/B, typhoid, and Japanese encephalitis based on your travel plans. Consult a travel medicine doctor before departure.

## What should I know about Indian customs and culture?

India is culturally diverse with strong religious traditions. Dress modestly, especially when visiting religious sites. Remove shoes before entering homes and temples. The right hand is preferred for eating and greeting. Respect local customs during festivals and religious observances. Tipping is customary in restaurants and for services.

## Can I extend my stay in India beyond my eVisa validity?

Tourist eVisas can be extended in exceptional circumstances through the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO). Extensions are not guaranteed and require valid reasons like medical emergency or flight cancellation. Business and other eVisa types have different extension policies. Plan your trip within the visa validity to avoid complications.

## What are the restricted and protected areas in India?

Some areas require special permits beyond the eVisa, including parts of Northeast India, certain border areas, and some islands. Ladakh, Sikkim (for some areas), and Andaman & Nicobar Islands may have additional requirements. Check with local authorities or your travel agent about permits needed for your specific destinations.

## What items are prohibited from bringing into India?

Prohibited items include narcotic drugs, weapons, satellite phones (without permission), certain electronic items, and beef products. Gold and silver above certain limits require declaration. Currency above $5,000 USD equivalent must be declared. Check the latest customs regulations before packing to avoid issues at immigration.

## How should I handle money and payments in India?

Indian Rupee (INR) is the local currency. ATMs are widely available in cities, but carry cash for rural areas. Credit cards are accepted in most hotels and restaurants in major cities. Inform your bank about travel plans to avoid card blocks. US Dollars and Euros can be exchanged at authorized dealers and airports.

## What transportation options are available in India?

India has extensive railway networks, domestic flights, buses, and taxis. Book train tickets in advance, especially during peak season. Use reputable taxi services or ride-sharing apps in cities. For long distances, consider domestic flights. Prepaid taxi counters at airports are reliable and safe options for new visitors.

## Is it safe to drink water and eat street food in India?

Stick to bottled or filtered water to avoid stomach issues. Avoid ice unless you're sure it's made from purified water. Street food can be delicious but choose busy stalls with high turnover. Eat hot, freshly cooked food and avoid raw salads or unpeeled fruits from street vendors. Hotel and restaurant food is generally safe.

## What should I do in case of emergency while in India?

Contact your embassy or consulate immediately. Keep emergency contacts handy and inform someone of your travel plans.

Keep important numbers handy: Police (100), Fire (101), Ambulance (102). Contact your embassy or consulate for serious issues. Keep copies of important documents separately. Travel insurance is highly recommended. Most major cities have good healthcare facilities, but medical evacuation insurance is advisable for remote area travel.
