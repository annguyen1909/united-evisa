## Do I need a visa to visit Kenya?

Most foreign nationals require a visa to enter Kenya. The Kenya eVisa system (Electronic Travel Authorization - ETA) allows eligible travelers from many countries to apply online for tourism, business, or transit purposes. Some nationalities may be visa-exempt for short stays, so it's important to check your specific eligibility on our platform before applying.

## How long does it take to process a Kenya eVisa?

Processing time for Kenya eVisas typically takes 3-5 working days for normal processing. We recommend applying at least 1 week before your intended travel date to avoid any delays. Our platform has a 98% approval rate, and we provide 24/7 support throughout the application process to ensure smooth processing.

## What documents do I need for a Kenya eVisa?

You'll need a valid passport with at least 6 months validity beyond your intended stay, a recent passport-size photo, proof of accommodation in Kenya, return or onward flight tickets, and sufficient funds for your stay. For business visas, you may need additional documents like invitation letters. All documents should be clear, legible, and in English.

## What are the different types of Kenya eVisas available?

Kenya offers three main types of eVisas: Tourist ETA (Single Entry for 90 days) costing $95 USD for safari tours, beach holidays, and cultural visits; Business ETA (Single Entry for 90 days) costing $95 USD for business meetings, conferences, and trade shows; and Transit ETA (Single Entry for 72 hours) costing $65 USD for airport transit and short layovers.

## Can I extend my Kenya visa while in the country?

Yes, extensions are possible for valid reasons such as medical treatment, business needs, or extended tourism. You'll need to visit the local immigration office in Nairobi or other major cities before your current visa expires. The extension process requires proper documentation, justification, and payment of additional fees. Processing can take several days.

## Is Kenya safe for tourists, especially for safari activities?

Yes, Kenya is generally safe for tourists, especially when using reputable tour operators and following local guidance. Safari areas like Maasai Mara are well-managed with experienced guides. However, it's important to follow safety protocols during wildlife encounters, stay with your group, and use established tour companies. Most tourist areas have good security measures in place.

## What is the best time to visit Kenya for safaris?

The best time for safaris in Kenya is during the dry seasons: January-March and June-October. The Great Migration in Maasai Mara typically occurs from July to October, offering spectacular wildlife viewing. The dry season provides better wildlife visibility as animals gather around water sources. Avoid the rainy seasons (April-May and November-December) when roads can be challenging.

## What are the must-visit destinations in Kenya?

Popular destinations include Maasai Mara National Reserve (famous for the Great Migration), Amboseli National Park (views of Mount Kilimanjaro), Tsavo National Parks (largest wildlife sanctuary), Lake Nakuru (flamingo viewing), Samburu National Reserve (unique wildlife), Mombasa (coastal beaches and culture), and Nairobi (capital city and starting point for safaris).

## What should I know about Kenyan culture and customs?

Kenya is culturally diverse with over 40 ethnic groups. Swahili and English are official languages. When visiting Maasai communities, be respectful of their traditions and ask permission before photographing. Dress modestly, especially in rural areas and when visiting religious sites. Kenyans are generally friendly and hospitable. Tipping is customary for safari guides and hotel staff.

## What health precautions should I take when visiting Kenya?

Yellow fever vaccination is required if coming from an infected area. Malaria prophylaxis is recommended, especially for safari areas and coastal regions. Ensure routine vaccinations are up to date. Use insect repellent and protective clothing. Drink bottled or treated water. Consider travel insurance that covers medical evacuation. Consult a travel health clinic before departure for personalized advice.
