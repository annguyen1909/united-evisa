## Do I need a visa to visit Malaysia?

Visa requirements for Malaysia depend on your nationality and purpose of visit. Many countries are eligible for visa-free entry for tourism (14-90 days depending on nationality), while others require an eVisa or traditional visa. The eVisa system is available for eligible nationalities for tourism, business, and transit purposes. ASEAN countries have special arrangements for easier travel.

## How long does it take to process a Malaysia eVisa?

Processing time for Malaysia eVisas typically takes 2-7 working days for standard applications. Most tourist eVisas are processed within 3-5 working days. We recommend applying at least one week before your intended travel date. During peak seasons (Chinese New Year, Hari Raya, year-end holidays), processing may take longer due to increased application volumes.

## What documents do I need for a Malaysia eVisa?

Required documents include a valid passport with at least 6 months validity beyond your intended stay and at least one blank page, recent passport-size photo with white background, proof of accommodation in Malaysia (hotel bookings or invitation letter), return or onward flight tickets, and bank statements showing sufficient funds for your stay. Yellow fever vaccination certificate is required if arriving from an infected area.

## What are the different types of Malaysia eVisas available?

Malaysia offers eVisa for Tourism (30 days, single entry), eVisa for Business (30 days for business meetings), and Transit Pass (120 hours for Kuala Lumpur transit). Some nationalities can also apply for Multiple Entry Visa (valid for 3 months to 1 year). Electronic Travel Registration & Information (eNTRI) is available for Chinese and Indian nationals for 15-day stays.

## Can I extend my Malaysia visa while in the country?

Tourist visa extensions are generally not permitted, and visitors are expected to leave before their visa expires. However, in exceptional circumstances such as medical emergencies or other valid reasons, extensions may be considered by the Immigration Department. Business and other visa categories may have different extension policies. It's advisable to plan your stay within the permitted duration.

## Is Malaysia safe for tourists?

Yes, Malaysia is generally safe for tourists with low crime rates in most tourist areas. The country has good infrastructure, healthcare facilities, and tourist police in major destinations. Standard travel precautions should be taken: be aware of your surroundings, avoid displaying valuables, and stay in well-lit areas at night. Natural hazards like occasional flooding during monsoon seasons should be considered.

## What is the best time to visit Malaysia?

Malaysia has a tropical climate with year-round warmth and humidity. The best time depends on the region you're visiting. For the west coast (Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Langkawi), November-March offers less rainfall. For the east coast (Perhentian Islands, Redang), March-September is ideal as many resorts close during monsoon (November-February). Sabah and Sarawak can be visited year-round.

## What are the must-visit destinations in Malaysia?

Essential destinations include Kuala Lumpur (Petronas Towers, Batu Caves, diverse cuisine), George Town, Penang (UNESCO heritage, street food), Malacca (historical sites, Peranakan culture), Perhentian Islands (pristine beaches, diving), Langkawi (duty-free island, cable car), Cameron Highlands (tea plantations, cool climate), and Malaysian Borneo (Kinabalu Park, orangutans, tribal culture).

## What should I know about Malaysian culture and customs?

Malaysia is a multicultural society with Malay, Chinese, and Indian influences. Bahasa Malaysia is the official language, but English is widely spoken. The majority are Muslim, with Buddhist, Christian, and Hindu minorities. Remove shoes when entering homes and some shops. Dress modestly, especially when visiting mosques and rural areas. The left hand is considered unclean for giving/receiving. "Budi" (kindness) is highly valued.

## What health precautions should I take when visiting Malaysia?

No specific vaccinations are required unless arriving from a yellow fever area, but ensure routine vaccinations are current. Dengue fever risk exists, so use mosquito repellent and protective clothing. Malaria risk is low but present in remote jungle areas of Sabah and Sarawak. Japanese encephalitis vaccination may be recommended for extended rural stays. Tap water is generally safe in cities, but bottled water is advisable.
