Most foreign nationals require a visa to enter New Zealand, except for Australian citizens and residents who can enter freely. The requirements depend on your nationality and the purpose of your visit.

## Visa Requirements by Nationality

### Visa Waiver Countries
Citizens from visa waiver countries need to apply for a **New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA)** before traveling. This includes citizens from:
- United States
- United Kingdom
- Canada
- Germany
- France
- Japan
- And many other countries

### Other Nationalities
If your country is not on the visa waiver list, you'll need to apply for a **visitor visa** through Immigration New Zealand.

## NZeTA vs Visitor Visa

### NZeTA (Electronic Travel Authority)
- **Cost**: NZD $23 (online) or NZD $17 (mobile app)
- **Processing time**: Usually processed within 10 minutes to 72 hours
- **Validity**: Multiple entries for up to 2 years
- **Stay duration**: Up to 90 days per visit
- **Purpose**: Tourism, business, or visiting family/friends

### Visitor Visa
- **Cost**: From NZD $211
- **Processing time**: 15-25 working days
- **Validity**: Varies (up to 9 months)
- **Stay duration**: As specified in the visa
- **Purpose**: Tourism, business, family visits, or other approved activities

## Additional Requirements

Regardless of your visa type, you must also have:
- A passport valid for at least 3 months beyond your departure date
- Proof of onward travel (return or onward ticket)
- Sufficient funds for your stay (NZD $1,000 per month or NZD $400 per month with prepaid accommodation)
- No serious criminal convictions

## International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy (IVL)

All visitors (except Australian citizens and residents) must pay the **International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy (IVL)** of NZD $35. This can be paid:
- With your NZeTA application
- With your visitor visa application
- Separately online before travel

## Special Cases

### Australian Citizens and Residents
- No visa or NZeTA required
- Can live and work in New Zealand indefinitely
- Must still pay the IVL

### Transit Passengers
If you're transiting through New Zealand and staying in the international transit area, you generally don't need a visa. However, if you plan to leave the airport, you'll need the appropriate visa or NZeTA.

## How to Check Your Requirements

To confirm your specific requirements:
1. Visit the official Immigration New Zealand website
2. Use their visa checker tool
3. Enter your nationality and travel purpose
4. Follow the recommendations provided

Remember that visa requirements can change, so always check the most current information before traveling.
