- **Online website**: NZ$23 + IVL NZ$35 = **Total NZ$58**

### What is the International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy?

### Are there any exemptions from the IVL?

## Travel Requirements

### Can I work in New Zealand with NZeTA?
No, the NZeTA does not allow you to work in New Zealand. It's only for tourism, business meetings, or transit purposes. You need a work visa to work in New Zealand.

### Can I study in New Zealand with NZeTA?
You can attend short-term courses (up to 3 months) with NZeTA, but for longer study programs, you need a student visa.

### What if my passport expires while my NZeTA is still valid?
If you get a new passport, you need to apply for a new NZeTA as it's linked to your specific passport number.

## Common Issues

### My NZeTA application was declined. What should I do?
If your NZeTA is declined, you need to apply for a visitor visa instead. Common reasons for decline include:
- Previous immigration violations
- Criminal history
- Health concerns
- Insufficient information provided

### Can I extend my stay beyond 3 months?
With NZeTA, you cannot extend your stay beyond 3 months. You must leave New Zealand and can return later (subject to immigration officer discretion).

### Do I need NZeTA for connecting flights through New Zealand?
Yes, even if you're just transiting through New Zealand's international airport, you need NZeTA and must pay the IVL.

## Health and Safety

### Are there health requirements for NZeTA?
New Zealand has strict biosecurity laws. You must declare any:
- Food items
- Plant or animal products
- Outdoor equipment that may carry soil or seeds
- Medications

### Do I need travel insurance for New Zealand?
While not mandatory for NZeTA holders, travel insurance is highly recommended as New Zealand has expensive healthcare costs for visitors.

## Special Circumstances

### Can I apply for NZeTA if I have a criminal record?
Having a criminal record doesn't automatically disqualify you, but you must declare it in your application. Immigration New Zealand will assess each case individually.

### What if I need to travel urgently and my NZeTA is still processing?
NZeTA processing cannot be expedited. If you need urgent travel, you may need to apply for a visitor visa instead, which has emergency processing options.

### Can I apply for multiple people in one application?
No, each person (including children) needs their own individual NZeTA application, even if traveling together.

## Contact and Support

### Where can I check my NZeTA status?
You can check your application status:
- Through the NZeTA mobile app
- On the Immigration New Zealand website using your application number
- By contacting Immigration New Zealand directly

### What should I do if I don't receive my NZeTA?
If you don't receive your NZeTA confirmation within the expected timeframe:
1. Check your spam/junk email folder
2. Verify your application status online
3. Contact Immigration New Zealand if the status shows approved but you haven't received it
