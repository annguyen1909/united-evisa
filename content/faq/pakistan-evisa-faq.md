## Do I need a visa to visit Pakistan?

Most foreign nationals require a visa to enter Pakistan. The online visa system allows eligible travelers from many countries to apply for tourist, business, and other visa categories. Some countries may have visa-free arrangements or different entry requirements. SAARC countries and some others have specific visa policies, so it's important to check your nationality's eligibility.

## How long does it take to process a Pakistan eVisa?

Processing time for Pakistan eVisas typically takes 7-15 working days for standard applications. Tourist visas may be processed faster, while business and other categories might take longer. We recommend applying at least 3 weeks before your intended travel date to account for any potential delays or additional document requests, especially during peak travel seasons.

## What documents do I need for a Pakistan eVisa?

Required documents include a valid passport with at least 6 months validity beyond your intended stay, recent passport-size photos, proof of accommodation in Pakistan (hotel bookings or invitation letter), return or onward flight tickets, bank statements showing sufficient funds, and a detailed travel itinerary. Additional documents may be required based on your visa category and nationality.

## What are the different types of Pakistan eVisas available?

Pakistan offers Tourist Visa (30-90 days for sightseeing), Business Visa (30-90 days for business activities), Visit Visa (for visiting family/friends), Transit Visa (for airport transit), and Pilgrimage Visa (for religious visits). Single and multiple entry options are available. Some visas can be extended within Pakistan through the relevant immigration authorities.

## Can I extend my Pakistan visa while in the country?

Yes, visa extensions are possible through the Passport and Immigration Office or regional immigration authorities. You must apply before your current visa expires and provide valid reasons for extension such as medical treatment, family circumstances, or extended business needs. The process requires proper documentation, application forms, and fees. Processing can take several days to weeks.

## Is Pakistan safe for tourists?

Pakistan's security situation has improved significantly in recent years, and many areas are safe for tourists, especially popular destinations like northern regions (Hunza, Skardu, Gilgit-Baltistan), Lahore, and Islamabad. However, security conditions can vary by region. It's advisable to stay updated on current security situations, follow local guidance, and consider hiring local guides for remote areas.

## What is the best time to visit Pakistan?

The best time depends on the region you're visiting. For northern areas (Hunza, K2 base camp), May-October offers pleasant weather and accessible roads. For cities like Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad, October-March provides cooler temperatures. Winter (December-February) can be very cold in mountainous regions. Monsoon season (July-September) affects some areas with heavy rainfall.

## What are the must-visit destinations in Pakistan?

Essential destinations include Hunza Valley (stunning mountain scenery), Skardu (gateway to K2), Lahore (historical city, Badshahi Mosque), Islamabad (modern capital), Karachi (commercial hub, Arabian Sea), Multan (ancient city, Sufi shrines), Peshawar (historical significance), and the ancient sites of Taxila and Mohenjo-daro. Northern areas offer spectacular trekking and mountaineering opportunities.

## What should I know about Pakistani culture and customs?

Pakistan is an Islamic republic with rich cultural diversity. Urdu is the national language, with English widely spoken. Islam plays a central role in daily life and culture. Dress modestly, especially when visiting religious sites. During Ramadan, respect fasting hours. Pakistani hospitality is legendary - guests are treated with great honor. Remove shoes when entering homes and mosques. The right hand is used for eating and greeting.

## What health precautions should I take when visiting Pakistan?

Ensure routine vaccinations are current and consider hepatitis A and B, typhoid, and Japanese encephalitis vaccinations. Malaria risk exists in some areas, so consider prophylaxis if visiting rural regions. Polio vaccination may be required for travel to certain countries after visiting Pakistan. Drink bottled or boiled water, avoid raw foods from street vendors. Air pollution can be an issue in major cities. Comprehensive travel insurance is essential.
