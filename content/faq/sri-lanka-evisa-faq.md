## Do I need a visa to visit Sri Lanka?

Most foreign nationals require a visa to enter Sri Lanka. The Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) system allows eligible travelers to apply online for tourism, business, and transit purposes. Some countries have visa-free arrangements for short stays, while others may require traditional visa applications through embassies or consulates.

## How long does it take to process a Sri Lanka eVisa (ETA)?

Processing time for Sri Lanka ETA is typically 1-3 working days for standard applications. Most applications are approved within 24-72 hours. We recommend applying at least one week before your intended travel date to allow for any potential delays or additional document requests, especially during peak tourist seasons.

## What documents do I need for a Sri Lanka eVisa?

You'll need a valid passport with at least 6 months validity beyond your intended stay, a recent passport-size digital photo, proof of accommodation in Sri Lanka (hotel bookings or invitation letter), return or onward flight tickets, and proof of sufficient funds for your stay. A yellow fever vaccination certificate is required if arriving from an infected area.

## What are the different types of Sri Lanka eVisas available?

Sri Lanka offers Tourist ETA (30 days, extendable to 6 months) for sightseeing and leisure; Business ETA (30 days, extendable to 3 months) for business meetings and conferences; Transit ETA (2 days) for airport transit; and Double Entry Tourist ETA for multiple visits. Each visa type has specific requirements and validity periods.

## Can I extend my Sri Lanka visa while in the country?

Yes, tourist visas can be extended up to 6 months total stay, and business visas up to 3 months. Extensions must be applied for through the Department of Immigration and Emigration in Colombo before your current visa expires. You'll need to provide justification, additional documentation, and pay extension fees. Processing typically takes 3-5 working days.

## Is Sri Lanka safe for tourists?

Yes, Sri Lanka is generally safe for tourists. The country has recovered well from past conflicts and the 2019 incidents. Tourist areas like Colombo, Kandy, Galle, and popular beaches have good security measures. Follow standard travel precautions, be aware of your surroundings, and stay updated on local conditions. Most tourists have safe and enjoyable experiences.

## What is the best time to visit Sri Lanka?

Sri Lanka has two monsoon seasons affecting different regions at different times. December-March is ideal for the west and south coasts (Colombo, Galle, beaches). May-September is best for the east coast (Trincomalee, Arugam Bay) and cultural triangle (Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa). The hill country (Kandy, Nuwara Eliya) can be visited year-round but is coolest December-March.

## What are the must-visit destinations in Sri Lanka?

Essential destinations include Colombo (capital city with colonial architecture), Kandy (Temple of the Tooth, cultural shows), Sigiriya (ancient rock fortress), Anuradhapura (ancient ruins), Galle (Dutch fort, colonial charm), Nuwara Eliya (tea plantations, cool climate), Yala National Park (leopard safaris), and beautiful beaches like Mirissa, Unawatuna, and Arugam Bay.

## What should I know about Sri Lankan culture and customs?

Sri Lanka is predominantly Buddhist with Hindu, Christian, and Muslim minorities. Sinhala and Tamil are official languages, with English widely spoken. Remove shoes when entering temples, dress modestly at religious sites, and show respect for Buddha statues. The right hand is used for giving and receiving. "Ayubowan" (may you live long) is a traditional greeting. Hospitality is highly valued.

## What health precautions should I take when visiting Sri Lanka?

No specific vaccinations are required unless arriving from a yellow fever area. Ensure routine vaccinations are current. Dengue fever risk exists, so use mosquito repellent and protective clothing. Malaria risk is low but present in some rural areas. Drink bottled or boiled water, avoid raw foods from street vendors. Japanese encephalitis vaccination may be recommended for extended rural stays.
