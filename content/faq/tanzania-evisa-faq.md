## Can I extend my Tanzania visa while in the country?

You'll need to visit the Immigration Department in Dar es Salaam, Arusha, or other regional offices before your current visa expires. The extension process requires proper documentation, justification, and payment of additional fees. Processing can take several days.

## Is Tanzania safe for tourists, especially for safari and Mount Kilimanjaro?

Yes, Tanzania is generally safe for tourists, especially when using reputable tour operators and following local guidance. Safari areas like Serengeti and Ngorongoro Crater are well-managed with experienced guides. For Mount Kilimanjaro, use certified guides and proper equipment. Most tourist areas have good security measures, but standard safety precautions should be taken.

## What is the best time to visit Tanzania for safaris and climbing?

The best time for safaris is during the dry seasons: June-October and January-February when wildlife viewing is optimal. The Great Migration occurs year-round but is most spectacular in Serengeti from December to July. For Mount Kilimanjaro, the best climbing seasons are January-March and June-October when weather conditions are most favorable with clearer skies.

## What are the must-visit destinations in Tanzania?

Essential destinations include Serengeti National Park (Great Migration and Big Five), Ngorongoro Crater (world's largest intact caldera), Mount Kilimanjaro (Africa's highest peak), Tarangire National Park (elephant herds), Lake Manyara (tree-climbing lions), Zanzibar (pristine beaches and Stone Town), and Ruaha National Park (largest park with diverse wildlife).

## What should I know about Tanzanian culture and customs?

Tanzania is culturally diverse with over 120 ethnic groups. Swahili and English are official languages. The majority are Christian or Muslim, with traditional beliefs also present. Respect local customs, dress modestly especially in Muslim areas and Stone Town. Greetings are important - "Jambo" (hello) and "Karibu" (welcome) are commonly used. Tipping is customary for safari guides and hotel staff.

## What health precautions should I take when visiting Tanzania?

Yellow fever vaccination is required if coming from an infected area and recommended for all travelers. Malaria prophylaxis is essential, especially for safari areas and Zanzibar. Ensure routine vaccinations are current. Use insect repellent and protective clothing. Drink bottled or treated water. Consider altitude sickness medication for Mount Kilimanjaro. Comprehensive travel insurance including medical evacuation is highly recommended.
