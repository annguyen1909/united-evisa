Respect Islamic customs, especially when visiting mosques - dress modestly and remove shoes. Hospitality is central to Uzbek culture - guests are highly honored. Try traditional foods like plov (pilaf), manti (dumplings), and green tea. Friday is the holy day, so some businesses may have limited hours.

Uzbekistan was at the heart of the ancient Silk Road trade routes connecting East and West. Cities like Samarkand, Bukhara, and Khiva were major trading centers where merchants, scholars, and travelers exchanged goods, ideas, and cultures. Today, you can explore well-preserved caravanserais, madrasas, mosques, and mausoleums that showcase this incredible historical legacy and architectural mastery.
