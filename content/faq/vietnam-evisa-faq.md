## What documents do I need for a Vietnam eVisa?

You'll need a valid passport with at least 6 months validity beyond your intended stay, a recent passport-size photo, proof of accommodation in Vietnam, return or onward flight tickets, and sufficient funds for your stay. For business eVisas, you may need additional supporting documents such as invitation letters. All documents should be clear, legible, and in English.

## Can I extend my Vietnam visa while in the country?

Yes, extensions are possible for valid reasons such as medical treatment, business needs, or extended tourism. You'll need to visit the local immigration office in major cities like Ho Chi Minh City or Hanoi before your current visa expires. The extension process requires proper documentation, and there are fees associated with extensions. Processing can take several days.

You can also enter through designated land borders with Cambodia, China, and Laos. Always carry your eVisa approval letter and passport when traveling.

## Is Vietnam safe for tourists?

Yes, Vietnam is generally safe for tourists with relatively low crime rates, especially in popular tourist areas. However, it's important to exercise standard safety precautions and be particularly aware of traffic in major cities like Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, where motorbikes are very common. Most tourist destinations have good security measures and infrastructure for visitors.

## What is the best time to visit Vietnam?

The best time to visit Vietnam depends on the region. Generally, March to May and September to November offer pleasant weather throughout the country. Avoid the rainy season (June-August) in the north, while the south has a tropical climate year-round. The weather varies significantly between north and south, so plan according to your intended destinations.

## What are the must-try experiences in Vietnam?

Vietnam offers incredible street food and culinary experiences - don't miss pho, banh mi, and fresh spring rolls. Popular destinations include Ho Chi Minh City for vibrant city life, Hanoi for history and culture, Ha Long Bay for scenic beauty, Hoi An for historic charm, Da Nang for beaches, Sapa for mountain trekking, and Nha Trang for coastal relaxation. Each region offers unique cultural and natural attractions.

## What should I know about Vietnamese culture and transportation?

Vietnamese culture emphasizes respect for elders and family values. When visiting temples and historical sites, dress modestly and remove shoes when required. Motorbikes are the primary mode of transportation - consider guided tours or reputable transport services rather than renting if you're not experienced. Be respectful when visiting sites related to the Vietnam War, as these hold significant historical importance for locals.
